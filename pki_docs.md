## Certificate Generation and Validation Process
#### Overview
understanding of the below commands is a mandatory requirement for the below procedure.
#### Pre-requisites
1. **OpenSSL**  
   Ensure that OpenSSL is installed on your machine.  
   ```bash
   # For macOS, use the following command
   brew install openssl

   # For Windows, download the installer from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

   # For Linux, use the following command
   sudo apt-get install openssl
   ```
```bash
2. **Certificate Authority (CA)**
    Contact the SPS CA team to get a user account and access to the CA server.
```
1. **Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and Private Key**  
   Execute the following command to create a CSR and a private key:  
   ```bash
   openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout private.key -out request.csr -subj "/CN=<your-bic>"
   ```
### Procedure for Generating and Verifying Certificates Using OpenSSL
2. **Submit the CSR to the Certificate Authority (CA)**  
   Copy the CSR content and submit it to the CA server:  
   ```bash
   # For macOS, use the following command
   cat request.csr | pbcopy 

   # For Windows, use the following command
   type request.csr | clip

   # For Linux, use the following command
   xclip -sel clip < request.csr

   # just in case, you can also use the following command to copy the content
   cat request.csr

   ```
   Paste the content into the CA's CSR submission form.

3. **Retrieve the Certificate**  
   After the CA administrator approves the CSR, download the `certnew.p7b` file in PEM format.

4. **Extract the Certificate Chain**  
   Convert the `certnew.p7b` file into a PEM format chain:  
   ```bash
   openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in certnew.p7b -out chain.pem

   # Extract the certificate from the chain file it's the first certificate in the chain
    openssl x509 -in chain.pem -out certificate.cer
    
    # You can also normally cut the certificate from the chain file using the following command
    cat chain.pem | sed -n '/-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/,/-----END CERTIFICATE-----/p' > certificate.cer

    # Also you can use normal text editor to cut the certificate from the chain file and save it as certificate.cer file

    # Remove the certificate from the chain file
    sed -i '/-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/,/-----END CERTIFICATE-----/d' chain.pem

    # Now the chain.pem file contains the chain of certificates (intermediate and root certificates)
   ```

5. **Validate Modulus Consistency**  
   Ensure the modulus of the private key, the certificate, and the CSR match:  
   ```bash
   openssl req -noout -modulus -in request.csr | openssl md5
   openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in certificate.cer | openssl md5
   openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in private.key | openssl md5
   ```

6. **Validate Certificate and Chain Modulus Consistency**  
   Verify that the modulus of the certificate matches the chain:  
   ```bash
   openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in certificate.cer | openssl md5
   openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in chain.pem | openssl md5
   ```

7. **Verify Certificate Validity**  
   Confirm the certificate's validity against the provided CA chain:  
   ```bash
   openssl verify -verbose -CAfile chain.pem certificate.cer
   ```

8. **Verify Certificate and Chain Completeness**  
   Check the certificate's validity and completeness of the chain:  
   ```bash
   openssl verify -verbose -CAfile chain.pem -untrusted chain.pem certificate.cer
   ```

9. **Install both intermediate and root certificates in your machine**  
   ```bash
    # For macOS, use the following command
    sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain intermediate.crt

    # For Windows, use the following command
    certutil -addstore -f "ROOT" intermediate.crt

    # For Linux, use the following command
    sudo cp intermediate.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/intermediate.crt
    sudo update-ca-certificates
   ```

This structured process ensures the secure generation, verification, and validation of certificates.

## I do not use windows or linux, so the commands are not tested on those platforms. Please test them on your own before using them, or simply use macOS ðŸ˜¬.
